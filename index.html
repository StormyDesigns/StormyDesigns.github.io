                <hr class="star-primary">

                <div class="portfolio-piece-section">
                  <h4> How it started</h4>
                  <p>In late April, I was spending my time binge watching <em>Portlandia</em>- a satirical sketch television show based in Portland, Oregon. The show got me thinking about how much I appriciate it when shows and other sources of entertainment are able to expose me to different issues in communities with me being genuinely interested in their content. </p>
                  
                  <img class="portfolio-image center-photo" src="img/Portlandia2.gif"/>
                  <p> When it comes to learning about world events and politics, watching shows like CNN and MSNBC gets dry pretty quickly. They never have formated a way to grab my interest as a young adult. However, someone such as John Oliver can have a segment on a current world issue that not only is entertaining, but help me stay informed and be more aware of the world around me than before.</p>
                  <p> Now don't get me wrong, CNN, The Onion, New York Times, and so on are great for certain people- but usually adults that arent part of the millinial crowd. And that let me to think, "What if I created a website that's just for millennials? It would be relatable and informative." And I thought of the best way catch the younger crowds attention with more mature article reads than a typical <em>BuzzFeed</em> page and that would be through something I know millenials love the most: Humor.</p>
                  <p> People my age have become masters of creating humorous content. With social media on the rise, there's humorous content created and passed on by the millions every day through memes, Reddit posts, Vines, and the list goes on and on. But not only has that made millenials develop a great semse of humor, but many young adults have used humor as a way to get their political message across or make others think deeper about a concerning issue.</p>
                  <img class="portfolio-image" id="zoo-image" src="img/Zoo.jpeg" />
                  
                  <p><em>Commentary about how people raged on social media about what the proper way of handling the situation of a child falling into a gorilla pit with no experience with animal training or creditials proving they fully undersrand the behavior of gorillas.</em></p>
                  <p>Millenials have the humor and critical thinking skills to spread their message to large audiences to get them to look at matters in different perspectives, however, when it comes to large mews content platforms- it's mainly people who are 30+ to writters leaving little room for young adults to have their voices heard.</p>
                  <p>And that's where my website, Mezz Pad comes in.</p>

                <div class="portfolio-piece-section">
                  <h4>Diving In</h4>
                  <p><strong>What is the purpose?</strong> The best way I can describe Mezz Pad is its The Onion for millennials. Mezz Pad is an online presenting noteworthy events according to Hipsters AKA millennials. Showcasing articles from both liberals and conservatives perspectives to inspire thought provoking discussions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> The audience I want to reach out to the most is of course, millennials. Teens and adults ages from 16 to 26. Some shared characteristics of them would be being tech savy, interested in reading news/sharing memes, and browsing through the internet daily in search of humorous content.</p>

                        I decided to conduct a survey that aims to understand what millennials look for in satirical news sites, what interests them, and how I can develop Mezz Pad to fit users interests more than existing competitors. </p>
                        <p>I posted the survey on Reddit and got 28 responses. The data I found to be the most important is listed below:</p>

                            <li>One of the main complaints I got from the survey responses is that satirical sites don't post content daily. In order to fix this issue I thought it would be a good idea to allow interested users to create their own content to share. This allows users to showcase their writing and read new content daily.</li>

                            <li>Survey responses reported that most satirical sites are biased - mostly with  liberal agenda. Mezz pad encourages both liberal and conservative voices to contribute their viewpoint.</li>

                        <h5 class="portfolio-header">Creating the name</h5>
                        <p> You're probably wondering, "What does Mezz Pad mean?" Well, I searched around for the fresh lingo that young people are using these days and I came across a "Hipster Dictionary". I learned that mezz means that something is the best, it's supreme- and all millenials love the best of the best. While pad means paper, such as newspaper. So the meaning of Mezz Pad is the best news around, something that millennials can't wait to read.</p>
                        <h5 class="portfolio-header">Designing the logo</h5>
                        <p>To get my creative juices flowing, I grabbed a peice of paper and wrote the word "Hipsters"- Mezz Pad's main focus- on top. I then wrote all the charactertics I thought made up hipsters. I thought of things like vintage, vegan, and casual. But what stuck on my mind the most was the word "mustache".</p>
                        <p>Mustaches and hipsters go together like mac and cheese. A signatue hip look is a well groomed 'stache to go along plaid shirt and blue jeans.</p>
                        <img class="stache-photo" src="img/portfolio/hipster_stache.jpg">
                        <p>One way I thought I could incorporate the mustache idea into my logo is by making the "M" in Mezz Pad look similar to a mustache.</p>
                        <h6 class="portfolio-header">Logo Sketch</h6>
                        <o>After a few sketches, I made one that I thought looked good.</o>
                        <img class="portfolio-header center-photo" src="img/portfolio/mustache-sketch.jpeg"/>
                        <p>I then used illustrator to give it osme life.</p>
                        <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/mustache2.png">
                        <p>It didn't look good to me so I thought maybe adding some dimendion to it would help.</p>
                        <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/mustache1.png">
                        <p>I didn't like how that turned out either. I spent some time wondering how I could improve my logo. I wanted a logo that looked like a mustache, but none of those sketches really looked like one. They didn't have the big iconic round curves and any real hint of a mustache other than the slight upward curve at the bottom.</p>
                        <p>After making a couple of adjustments, I created a logo that I did like.</p>
                        <img  class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/mustache3.png">
                        <p>There's a few reasons why I was happy with this logo:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>It follows the flat design look which is one of the top design trends of 2016</li>
                          <li>It incorporates the signaure shape of a traditional "hipster" mustache while still easily being recognized being a letter M</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 class="portfolio-header">Designing the Website</h4>
                        <p>Ny goal for designing Mezz Pad was making it look modern. I tried doing so by creating an asymetric layout to give viewers interest. I also gave an incongruent frame to a few articles to add onto the asymetric aesthetic.</p>

                        <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/Sign_In_LR.png">
                        <p>I decided to opt out of the hamburger menu trend and instead use a top tabbed menu instead. I chose this option because it clearly states what each tab is for, it allows users to quickly switch to a differen't page, and users can easily see what page they are at a glance.</p>
                        <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/iPhone_Home_View_LR.png">

                        <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/iPhone_Search_View_LR.png">
                        <p>The color palette I chose to work with is white and hot pink. Hot pink is a color I noticed used by companies such as T-Mobile to symboloize fun and modern, plus appealing to the younger crowds- like millennials.  </p>

                        <h4 class="portfolio-header">Key Takeaways</h4>
                        <p>The main thing I learned after designing Mezz Pad is: <strong>DON'T RUSH</strong>. A good design takes time. I might spend hours redesigning something over and over until I get a feeling that it's right, and I can't get flustered over it. Taking out the time to do research on competitive analysis, understanding what users want, and getting feedback on my design is a long process, but those are the steps needed to create a good product. And overall, I'm happy that I took out the time so I could create something that I am proud of.</p>

                <h2>Sweet Equations Internship</h2>
                <hr class="star-primary">
                <img src="img/portfolio/papparazi-cake.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                <p><strong>Position:</strong> Graphic Design & Marketing Intern</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> May 201 - August 2016</p>
                <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="http://www.sweetequations.com/">SweetEquations.com</a></p>
                <p>Sweet Equations is an up and coming bakery in  East Hartford, Connecticut. They create unique cakes and "uncupcakes" which look like regular cakes and cupcakes on the inside, but on the outside, they're decorated with a variety of candy. I was very excited to work for them since I have a huge sweet tooth. I couldn't have asked for a sweeter internship.</p>
                <p>Here's a couple of their unique treats:</p>
                <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/cookies-n-cream-cake.jpg">
                <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/chocolate-candy-cake.jpg">
                <h4 class="portfolio-header">Creating Marketing Strategies</h4>
                <P>As an intern, my main job was to help Sweet Equations increase their followers on Facebook and Instagram through engaging marketing techniques.</p>
                <p> I started by researching the best Instagram user engagement stratagies that I could incorporate into Sweet Equations. After browsing through popular bakeries on Instagram, I noticed a few great strategies to use:</p>
                <h5 class="portfolio-header">Showing the love</h5>
                <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/user-engagement.png">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Share a video/photo of your or your employees working. Show customers the great faces who make the food they love.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>Also post photos of customers and share something about them. Show customers that you care about them and they're likely to come back.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="portfolio-header">Eye Candy</h5>
                <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/user-engagement2.png">
                <ul>
                  <li><p>Take eye catching photos of your treats. The more unique and dynamic your photo is, the more likely users will be drawn to look at your profile, follow you, share the photos and come into the bakery.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Use hashtags like #bakery, #cakes, #sweettreats and others so that users can find your post when they’re searching for treats.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5 class="portfolio-header">Sponsored Posts</h5>
              <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/user-engagement3.png">
              <p>This tactic comes at a price, but when done right it can make a large impact on your account.</p>
              <p>To get started, search for large bakery accounts (20k ­ 200k) followers and and look for an email address on their profile. If the address is listed, it usually means that they’re open to sponsored posts. I can send them an email asking about sponsored post pricing, I’ve seen that the average cost is around $20 ­ $50 per post depending on the size of the following. And Sweet Equations can even send them a cake for them to review and share. The more natural and genuine a sponsored ad looks, the more engagement you’ll get.</p>
              <p>I personally find it to be one of the best strategies to use. Most accounts are flooded with followers after they get sponsored.</p>
              <h5 class="portfolio-header">Gaining Insight</h5>
              <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/user-engagement4.png">
              <p>I highly recommend Sweet Equations to use Iconosquare  <a href="http://iconosquare.com">(http://iconosquare.com)</a>. They provide advanced analytics about instagram accounts to help gain more followers and engagement. The features I think that would help the growth of Sweet Equations are:</p>
              <ul id="growth-list">
                <li><p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>See the growth history of likes and comments received.</p></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              
              <li><p><strong>Hashtag Performance</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>See which hashtags are the best to use to gain the most likes, views, and follows.</p></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Optimization</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>See which times are the best to post and see the lifespan of your posts.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><p><strong>Rolling month analysis</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>See content, engagement and follower stats within the last 30 days.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="portfolio-header">Going live on Instagram</h4>
      <p>My next task after creating user engagement strategies was to create an Instageam account for them and gain 10 followers within a week. I didn't have the opprunity to take any own eye catching photos of their cakes due to me being in a different state, and their photographer wasn't avaibable to take any new photos, but I did the best with what I had an ended up helping them gain 25 followers in one week.</p>
      <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/sweet-equations-instagram.jpg">
      <h4 class="portfolio-header">Affiliate Marketing</h4>
      <p>My next assignment for Sweet Equations was to learn about affiliate marketing. I was given a week to find content about what affilliate marketing is and how I can attract others to become an affiliate for Sweet Equations by creating an affiliate page on their website.</p>
      <p>During this time, their website was under construction so they didn't have anything for me to get an idea how their website is strctured except for a shot of their homepage.</p>
      <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/sweet-equations-layout.JPEG">
      <p> Based off the homepage, this is the afilliate page that I came up with:</p>
      <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/sweet-equations-affiliate1.png">
      <p>I got feedback on the affiliate page and the creator of Sweet Equations, Sade, asked me to include a different banner and include extra information about being an affiliate. After discussing and redesigning the affiliate page, the final version came out like this:</p>
      <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/sweet-equations-affiliate2.png">
      <p>I was very happy with the result because I was able to make the page inviting and provide information in a fun and intriguing way by including icons that emphasize the best perks of being an affiliate and including additional reasoning to become an affiliate without the page looking cluttered.</p>
      <h4 class="portfolio-header">Overall Experience </h4>
      <p>Interning for Sweet Equations was a fun experience. I didn't get to do as many design projects as I had hoped, but I gained more knowledge and skill with marketing to make up for it. Getting to help someone's new business succeed is an experience I'll always remember.</p>
