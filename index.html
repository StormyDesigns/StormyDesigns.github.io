                <h2>PlayFull Case Study</h2>
                <hr class="star-primary">
                <img src="img/portfolio/playfull.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
             
                  <h4> Company Info</h4>
                  <p>Playfull is a mobile app that allows users to play games, earn points, and use to points to get free food at their partner restaurants including Chick-Fil-A, Subway, Denny’s, and more. Simultaneously, PlayFull helps restaurants retain customers through games.</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Task</h4>
                  <p>Design an order ahead feature for the PlayFull app</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Problem</h4>
                  <p>PlayFull has two users; the ones looking for discounted food at restaurants, and restaurants looking for more customers. The biggest complaints from users was that there not enough restaurants on the app. Playfull’s partnered restaurants are limited to UCLA, preventing users from being able to redeem their rewards outside of the UCLA area. The process of adding additional restaurants to the app was a lengthy process. The company would spends months trying to establish a relationship with each restaurant for the chance that they would agree to partner with Playfull, and usually that partnership would not form. The limited partnered restaurants that were on the app and the rate each partnership formed, was not enough to satisfy users nor satisfy the company’s goal of efficiently expanding outside of UCLA.</p>
               
                  <p>The biggest issue with restaurants was that they had difficulty using the PlayPad, which is a customer-facing tablet next to the restaurants POS that ensures secured transactions. It required employees to be trained to learn how to use it and it would frequently power off without restaurants knowing how to turn it on, requiring repeated maintenance. </p>
                 
                  <p>LevelUp, an order ahead service that expressed interest in integrating their API into the PlayFull app, allowing users order food from their phone instead of in person, which theoretically should cause an increase in revenue for restaurants. In addition, Playfull would receive access to LevelUp’s restaurant network, giving users a greater selection of stores to order from. In order for the partnership to be a success, PlayFull would need to design an order ahead feature within the app.</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Tools</h4>
                  <p>Sketch</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Process</h4>
                  <h5 class="portfolio-header">Observations</h5>
                  <p>I started off by researching popular order ahead apps. I drew out the app screens that I thought were successful on the right and wrote down a list of features for each app that I thought were successful on the left.</p>

                  <li><p>Can easily edit order at checkout</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  </ul>  
                 
                  <p>From there I wrote a list of features I thought would be important to include in Playfull’s order ahead feature that would make it a positive experience for users.</p>

                 <h5 class="portfolio-header">Sketching Ideas</h5>
                 <p>I started to sketch out some ideas for designing the order ahead feature based off my research.</p>

                  <h5 class="portfolio-header">Lo-fi Sketches</h5>
                  <p>Once I had a general sense of what I wanted the order ahead feature to look like, I created a set of lo-fi sketches and detailed information about how each screen would function.

                <h4> Usability Testing</h4>

                <p> I went to UCLA's campus and asked students for the opinion on the app.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Here are some of the questions I asked:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>Let’s imagine you’ve just opened up the app. What do you think you can do from this screen?</p></li>

                <li><p>How well did the order ahead feature meet your needs?</p></li>

                <li><p>Imaging that you were free to roam, how likely would you be to explore different sections of the app? Why?</p></li>

                <li><p>If you could change 1 thing about this feature, what would those be?</p></li>
               </ul>

               <h4 class="portfolio-header">Analyzing Feedback </h4>

               <p>I made a user testing summary report to outline the main responses I received from users. I learned that overall, users enjoyed the ordering experience, but they prefered if the open and close icons were removed. As a result, I came up with the idea to have open restuarants featured at the top of the page, while closed restuarants were at the bottom of the page and grayed out to indicate that it wasn't open.</p>

              <h5 class="portfolio-header">New Iteration</h5>
              <p>I concluded that next and momentarily final iteration of the feature would satisfy the users needs to placing an order. Here's the final prototype:</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Description</h4>
                  <p>Good&Co is a matchmaker-meets-career-guidance-counselor app that connects people, companies, and workplaces. Good&Co uses personality tests to match job hunters with companies that best fit their characteristics and strengths.</p>
                  <p>I applied to Good&Co and was assigned a design challenge to be considered for their UI/UX internship position.</p>
                  <p>Design challenge prompt:  Redesign our karma point system and quiz screen. The current issues are; the users cannot go back on the quiz screen, the users has a hard time to figure out "tap to confirm answer". For the Karma point system, explore the app to find the flaws and report your findings/ proposal.</p>
                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Duration</h4>
                  <p>One week</p>
                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Tools Used</h4>
                  <p>For this design challenge, I used <strong>Sketch</strong> to recreate the Good&Co. app layout from scratch and used <strong>Principle</strong> for the animation.</p>
                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Goals for Case Study</h4>
                  <ul>
                  <li><p>Improve application usability and intuitiveness, specifically relating to how Karma Points are gained and their purpose.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Decrease user frustration with app controls.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Improve user satisfaction and retention (i.e. coming back to the app for  more).</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Current UX challenges</h4>
                  <p>To gather user feedback to identify pain points in the application, I asked a few of my friends to download the application and answer two short questions about their experience (with emphasis on quizzes & Karma Points).
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><p>Were you confused with how the scale worked or had any difficulties with using it? If so, please explain.</p></li>
                    <li><p>What are Karma Points and what are they used for?</p></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h5 class="portfolio-header">Quizes</h5>
                  <p>Pain points I had pre-identified by going through the application so far were:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Users can’t go back to previously answered questions.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The “tap to confirm” user action is confusing.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>From my user research, the main concerns users seemed to have about quizzes were:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Difficulty understanding the meaning of their scale position</strong></p></li>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>There was nothing to tell them if their choice meant that they slightly agreed, extremely agreed, or felt neutral about the two choices they had.</p></li>
                    <li><p>No contextual clues provided by scale color</p></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>The colors blue and purple weren’t significant colors that expressed that they slightly agreed, extremely agreed, or felt mutual about the two choices they had. A few suggested having a scale colors that went from red (slightly agree) to green (extremely agree).</p></li>
                     </ul>
                     </ul>
                     <li><p><strong>Unable to answer to answer previous questions</strong></p></li> 
                     <ul>
                       <li><p>Most of the users were expecting to see a “previous” and “continue” buttons to maneuver through the questions. Since those buttons weren’t there, their first instinct was to click the colored rectangle that held the previously answered question thinking that would allow them to reanswer the question.</p></li>
                     </ul>
                     </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <h5 class="portfolio-header">Karma Points</h5>
                  <p>Pain points I had pre-identified by going through the application so far were:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Users were mostly unaware of accumulating karma points.</strong></p></li>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>Users did not receive any feedback from the app that told them that they received karma points for sharing the app or strength card.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Good&Co. uses Karma Points to make users excited and want to take more quizzes, but users aren’t aware that they received Karma Points. When all the Karma Points alerts are hidden within the bell notification, users may not feel like their actions weren’t enough for a “congratulations” and stop using the app.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <p>From my user research, the main concerns users seemed to have about karma points were:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>They were unable to feel excited/value by gaining Karma Points.</strong></p></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>Gamification is powerful when the user feel accomplished.</p></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>Facebook users feel accomplished about their good-looking selfie when they get likes.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Pokemon Go users feel accomplished feel accomplished when they find a rare pokemon.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <li><p>When the user feels good, they come back for more. What these apps have in common is randomness. The Facebook user gets excited for the amount of likes they might possibly get, and Pokemon Go user gets excited for what a Poke Stop might have for them.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Proposed UX Solutions</h4>
                  <h5 class="portfolio-header">Quizzes</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users were confused about how scale values worked (e.g. what does it mean to shift the scale value slightly right or left?).</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Modify the scale to have discrete “checkpoints” for each choice.</p></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>The checkpoints on the scale help make users aware that their choice means slightly agree, extremely agree, or felt neutral about the two choices they have.</p></li>
                      <li><p>With distinct options, it’s easier for users to understand that once they move the slider button to the checkpoint that best fits them, they can tap to confirm to answer the next question.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="caption">Visual of the discrete scale solution</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users would like a way to change or view answers they provided to previous questions.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p></li>
                    <ul><li><p>
                      The first solution is allowing users to tap the colored rectangle at the top of the screen that contains the previous question. When the user taps the previous question, the previous question will then slide back into the frame in the current question section for the user to answer. Here’s a visual below.
                    </p></li></ul>

                    <ul>
                      <li><p>The next (more intuitive) solution that I have is create a carousel slider. Apps like Tinder and Spotify use these sliders to let users know that there is more to explore. Having a carousel slider for Good&Co. shows users that that their previous and future questions haven’t disappeared, they’re just off to the side and can be easily accessible by scrolling either left or right.</p></li>

                  <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users weren’t aware when they received Karma Points from certain actions.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Solution:</strong> My solution for Karma Points is having a modal pop-up thanking users for completing a task that allows them to earn Karma Points. This makes it clear to users that certain desired actions (like liking Good&Co.’s Facebook page) lead to positive in-app outcomes (getting Karma Points).</p></li>

                    <li><p><strong>Solution:</strong> To improve the gamification, users can receive “hidden” quizzes at random intervals of Karma Point gain. </p></li>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>For example, once the user completes 4 quizzes or shared the app with 5  friends and liked the Good&Co. Facebook page, users will be alerted that they earned a Karma Point free quiz for sharing the app with friends. </p></li>
                      <li><p>By making this random, it increases user engagement with the application and drive to continue staying on it (since a ‘random’ event can happen at any time).</p></li>
                      <li><p>This makes users more excited to share the app with friends and gains Good&Co. more users.</p></li>

            <h3>The Burger Spot Redesign</h3>
            <h4>How it started</h4>
            <p>One of my favorite restaurants is The Burger Spot. It's a diner famous for their burgers but I will always know them for their amazing wings. As much as I enjoy eating at the restaurant, their current logo is something I can't ignore- and not for good reasons.</p>
            <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/original_burger_spot.jpeg"/>
            <h4>Designing the logo</h4>
            <p>Their current logo doesn't properly express the restaurant's culture. The feelings I get from being inside the restaurant is a retro/vintage and family-friendly diner. However, their current logo is a thick sans serif font that isn't expressive. Without their imagery, I couldn't figure out what their typeface is trying to express to the people who pass by it.</p>
            <p>My first step when designing the logo was to figure how to convey the personality of the restaurant into the logo. The words I thought best described The Burger Spot was vintage, family-friendly, retro, and fun.</p>
            <p>My next step was then to start sketching.</p>
            <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/burger-sketch.jpeg"/>
            <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/burger-sketch2.jpeg"/>
            <p>I ended up liking this sketch the most so I scanned my sketch and placed into into Illustrator.</p>
            <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/the-burger-spot2.png"/>
            <p>After spending a couple of hours on refining the details, I ended up feeling pleased with the final result.</p>
            <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/the-burger-spot1.png"/>
            <p>What I love about the new logo is how I was able to convey the diners personality. All of the letters are round which express make viewers automatically think of fun. And the thick bubble letters look like vintage/retro letters that I studied for inspiration. The highlights I added were to reiterate the fun and bubbly feeling I was trying to express and it also looks like the font was written by squirting paint out of a bottle which goes along with their ketchup splat on their original logo. The reason why I chose red, white and black for the logo colors is because those colors are common colors that are found in diners.</p>
            <h3>Monogram</h3>
            <h4>How it started</h4>
            <p>For my typography assignment, I had to create a monogram. What I started off doing is thinking of what I wanted people to think when they viewed the logo since monograms are a representation of the person who designed it. What I wanted people to know by looking at the logo is that I am highly interested in modern/futuristic designs and I am also always evolving and changing my design styles not only for experimentation but also to be able to change my design style to best suit the need of a client.</p>
            <h4>Designing the monogram</h4>
            <P>I started off drawing different ways of drawing my initials, S and J together.</P>
            <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/logo-sketches.jpg"/>
            <p>I decided on 4 sketches that I really liked and go into more detail with them.</p>
            <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/monogram-sketches2.png"/>
            <p>I like the second monogram to the left the best and so I continued to refine it until I ended up with the final result.</p>
            <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/monogram.jpg"/>
            <p>What I like about this logo is that that it when I look at it or show it to others, the first word that comes to describe the monogram is "modern". The reason I chose to use gradients is because they are a popular design trend at the moment and I used them to express my fluid and evolving design style.</p>

          <h2>Expedia Redesign</h2>
          <hr class="star-primary">
          <img src="img/portfolio/expedia-logo.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
         <h4>Data about Expedia Users</h4>
         <ul>
         <li><p>According to <a href="https://advertising.expedia.com/audience/">https://advertising.expedia.com/audience/</a>, 58% of the users of Expedia are between the ages of 25 - 54.</p></li>
         <li><p>Interests: Entertainment, Dining out, Adventure, Outdoors, etc.</p></li>
         </ul>

         <h4 class="portfolio-header">Assumptions</h4>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Adults ages from 25 - 54 are busy with starting/raising a family, working, going to events - overall balancing work at time. Have little time to spend hours planning on finding a destination, dates that fits best with their schedule and budget.</p></li>
         </ul>

         <h4 class="portfolio-header">User Needs</h4>
           <ul>
           <li><p>An agent to help users find and book a trip</p></li>
           </ul>

         <h4>Proposed Solutions</h4>
         <h5 class="portfolio-header">Expedia Chatbot/AI</h5>
         <p>For planning trips and vacations, users can speak with an Expedia Bot. Selecting travel plans will be like interacting with a smart travel agent. The Expedia Bot will make smart decisions based on their proposed location, budget, time of year they want to go, etc. The user gives verbal responses like they would with Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. The Expedia Bot will take the information that the user gives to recommend flights, hotels, and complete travel packages.</p>

         <h5 class="portfolio-header">Calendar Upload/Sync</h5>
         <p>Users can upload/sync their calendar for the AI to parse the info to determine which dates would be the best for the user. Additionally, users can input their airport departure, total budget for flight, hotel, and car rental, and desired location.</p>

         <h5 class="portfolio-header">Travel List</h5>
         <p>If users are unsure of where they would like to travel, users will be given a questionnaire about their prefered weather conditions/environment and personal interests, to choose from. The AI will take the selected data into consideration and recommend the locations that complement the user’s desired choices and times available.</p>

         <h5 class="portfolio-header">One Touch Booking</h5>
         <p>Users can choose from a selection of hotels, flights, and complete travel plans that companies want to sell within 3 weeks. Since the selections need to be sold at the last minute, they have the highest discount to appeal to users. <br>
         Example: <a href="https://www.contiki.com/us/en">Contiki</a>
         </p>
        <img class="center-photo" src="img/portfolio/contiki.png"/>
         <p>User finds a travel option they like and select “Book Now”. They are taken to the shopping cart to review their selection. If the user is satisfied, then select “Confirm” and provide their payment information. Once the user confirms the travel plan, they cannot receive a refund.</p>

         <h5 class="portfolio-header">Synced Travel Plans</h5>
         <p>Once the user has confirmed their travel plans, the Expedia Bot will sync information such as upcoming flights, hotel details, and car rental information into their preferred calendar. Users will additionally receive notifications reminding them about their upcoming flight and travel plans.</p>

                  <h2>Slack Redesign</h2>
                  <hr class="star-primary">
                  <img src="img/portfolio/slack-logo.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Description</h4>
                  <p>My Slack redesign was done for the KPCB Fellows Program. The Fellows Program is a work-based program that pairs top U.S. Engineering, Design & Entrepreneurial students with innovative startup companies.</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Design Challenge</h4>
                  <p>Redesign a feature of of a KPCB company’s product. You are free to focus on any disciplinary area that you are strongest with: Visual Design, Interaction Design, User Experience, and/or User Interface Design.</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">KPCB Company Choice</h4>
                  <p>The KPBC company I chose to redesign is Slack.  Slack is an instant messaging and collaboration site that provides real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams.</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Exploring Questions</h4>
                  <p>To gather user feedback to identify pain points in the application, I asked a few of my friends who used Slack daily to answer three questions about their experience.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li><p>Do you have or had any difficulties with using Slack? If so, please explain.</p> </li>
                  <li><p>What is your favorite and least favorite feature on Slack?</p></li>
                  <li><p>If you could add/change one thing about how Slack works, what would it be?</p></li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Responses</h4>
                  <p>The most prominent response I received from my friends was that they had difficulty keeping track of conversations. For instance, many of my friends are part of channels with more than 20 members. The large amount can easily become problematic.  For example, when a group of members is discussing the channel topic with each other, and then another member breaks into the main discussion by bringing up another topic, it becomes difficult to tell what the main subject matter is.</p>

                  <p>The only solution to that problem has been creating another channel to move that sub-topic. But that creates a lot list of unwanted inactive channels on a user's feed to scroll through, making it difficult for a user to find their desired channel.</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">UX Challenge</h4>
                  <p><strong>Problem needed to solve:</strong> How can I refine the existing Slack UI to better allow users to introduce different topics into a channel without disrupting the main channel topic?</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Goals for Redesign</h4>
                  <ul>
                  <li><p>Improve application usability specifically relating to how the channel messages work.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Decrease user frustration with changing topics within a channel.</p></li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Proposed Solutions</h4>
                  <p>The solution I had for this issue is creating “temporary channels”. The way temporary channels works is that a member can create a sub-channel within the main channel. This allows members to be redirected into discussing a topic related to the main channel topic, without disrupting the other members in the main channel. What makes this solution better than creating another channel is that the temporary channel is only, temporary.</p>

                  <p>The channel will last up to 24 hours after the last message has been posted in the channel. This prevents users from having to scroll through a long list of inactive channels.  If a user is interested in keeping the sub-channel around, they are more than welcome to use the archive slash commands which is a feature already built into Slack.</p>

                  <h4 class="portfolio-header">Fleshing Out Ideas</h4>
                  <p>Before I started any high fidelity mockups, I created a user flow  to make sense of how my proposed “temporary channels” idea would work, and drew out my design ideas.</p>

                  Once a temporary channel has been created, members will be alerted by SlackBot that a temporary channel has been created. Members of the channel can join the temporary channel and invite other members to join. Once a temporary channel has been created, it is listed in the left sidebar underneath the active channel. Users can expand/close the list of temporary channels by selecting the downward chevron.</p>

                  <p class="caption">This is the temporary channel page view. Blue is used as a temporary channel color to help users differentiate between a temporary channel and main channel. When a user is on a temporary channel, they can return to the main channel by selecting the black, bolded main channel listed underneath the temporary channel.  Users can also select the temporary channel listed in the left sidebar underneath the active channel as mentioned previously.</p>

                  Another way of joining a channel is by selecting the “Channel Details” icon listen on the left side of the search bar. When “Temporary Channels” is selected, a dropdown of all the temporary channels will be listed containing the topic detail and the time remaining. Once the temporary channel name is selected, the user will be brought to the temporary channel page.</p>

                  <p class="caption">Members can find temporary channels by interesting the browse channels page. Members can scroll through the list of channels and view how many members are in the channel along with a number of temporary channels. If users are interested in viewing the name of the name of temporary channels, they can hover over a desired channel and select preview. That action will allow the member to preview a channel page. They can then select the “Channel Details” icon to view more information regarding the temporary channels.</p>
